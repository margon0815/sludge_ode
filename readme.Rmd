## Description

This repository contains various models based on R+Quarto/Shiny for teaching the interaction between aeration tanks and secondary clarifiers in wastewater treatment plants. The sludge balance and dynamic change in the interaction between dry weather inflow and combined inflow are of particular importance here. The documentation of the model approach clearly explains the derivation of the system of equations used in the scripts.
All documents are available in German and English.
